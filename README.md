A small CLI tool. With which you can generate passwords or tokens.

## Install

In order to use this tool, you must first install it. Before you start with this installation, check with `go version` if Go is already installed on your system. If you do not get a version number back, then you must first [install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install). This is done as follows:

1) You download this repository.
2) Now, using the terminal, change to the directory where you downloaded the repository. Here is an example: `cd goten-cli/`.
3) Please start the installation now by building the software: `./goten-cli.sh --build`.
4) Install the software with the command `./goten-cli.sh --install`.
5) Now you can use the goten command throughout your system. Like this `goten <length>`.
